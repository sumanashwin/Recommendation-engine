Problem Statement
You are the sales manager for "BeerMart", an online beer store in the United States.  You want to build a recommendation system (collaborative) for your store, where customers will be recommended the beer that they are most likely to buy. You collected the data about the ratings that the customers have provided in the past. You can download the dataset from the link below.

Description: Each record is composed of a beer's name, the name of the user along with ratings provided by users. All ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 with 5 being the best.

 

As you solve the case study, answer the following questions

Data preparation

Choose only those beers that have at least N number of reviews

Figure out an appropriate value of N using EDA; this may not have one correct answer, but you shouldn't choose beers having extremely low number of ratings

Convert this data frame to a “realratingMatrix” before you build your collaborative filtering models

Data Exploration

Determine how similar the first ten users are with each other and visualise it

Compute and visualise the similarity between the first 10 beers

What are the unique values of ratings?

Visualise the rating values and notice:

The average beer ratings

The average user ratings

The average number of ratings given to the beers

The average number of ratings given by the users

Recommendation Models

Divide your data into training and testing datasets

Experiment with 'split' and 'cross-validation' evaluation schemes

Build IBCF and UBCF models

Compare the performance of the two models and suggest the one that should be deployed

Plot the ROC curves for UBCF and IBCF and compare them

 Give the names of the top 5 beers that you would recommend to the users "cokes", "genog" & "giblet"
